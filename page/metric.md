This object contains metric values for entity objects. 
Most metrics are values associated with commodities bought or sold by the entity. 
Bought and sold commodities appear in separate objects - one for the buyer and one 
for the seller. In addition to topology metrics, a metric contains headroom properties, 
which are generated daily by headroom plans.
